pdfFiller: What can we help you with? ðŸ™‚


jeffchavez0828@gmail.com: Why am I get charged? 
    
    I didn't mean to renew.
    I was trying to find the cancel button last week but I can't seem to find it under billing. So I thought it would renew. 
    
    Please refund it. I am not using the service anymore.
    
    My account shows it's free. Why did you charge me?
